* Allwinner CryptoEngine / Security System found on A80/A83T/H3/A64 SoC

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be one of
	"allwinner,sun8i-h3-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun50i-a64-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun9i-a80-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-crypto"
- reg: Should contain the CE register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the CE. (Non secure IRQ if
  two exists)
- clocks : List of clock specifiers, corresponding to ahb and ce.
- clock-names : Name of the functional clock, should be
	* "ahb" : AHB gating clock
	* "mod" : CE/SS controller clock

Optional properties:
 - resets : phandle + reset specifier pair
 - reset-names : must contain "ahb"

Example:
	crypto: crypto-engine@01c15000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-crypto";
		reg = <0x01c15000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 86 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&ahb_gates 5>, <&ss_clk>;
		clock-names = "ahb", "mod";
	};
