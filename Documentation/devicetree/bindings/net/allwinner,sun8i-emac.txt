* Allwinner sun8i EMAC ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following string:
		"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-emac"
		"allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac"
		"allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac"
- reg: address and length of the register for the device.
- reg-names: should be "emac"
- syscon: A phandle to the syscon of the SoC
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- clocks: A phandle to the reference clock for this device
- clock-names: should be "ahb"
- resets: A phandle to the reset control for this device
- reset-names: should be "ahb"
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt
- phy or phy-handle: See ethernet.txt
- #address-cells: shall be 1
- #size-cells: shall be 0

"allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac" also requires:
- clocks: an extra phandle to the reference clock for the EPHY
- clock-names: an extra "ephy" entry matching the clocks property
- resets: an extra phandle to the reset control for the EPHY
- resets-names: an extra "ephy" entry matching the resets property

See ethernet.txt in the same directory for generic bindings for ethernet
controllers.

The device node referenced by "phy" or "phy-handle" should be a child node
of this node. See phy.txt for the generic PHY bindings.

Optional properties:
- allwinner,tx-delay: TX clock delay chain value. Range value is 0-0x07. Default is 0)
- allwinner,rx-delay: RX clock delay chain value. Range value is 0-0x1F. Default is 0)

The TX/RX clock delay chain settings are board specific.

Optional properties for "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac":
- allwinner,leds-active-low: EPHY LEDs are active low

Example:

emac: ethernet@01c0b000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac";
	syscon = <&syscon>;
	reg = <0x01c0b000 0x104>;
	reg-names = "emac";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 82 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_EMAC>, <<&ccu RST_BUS_EPHY>;
	reset-names = "ahb", "ephy";
	clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_EMAC>, <&ccu CLK_BUS_EPHY>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "ephy";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	phy = <&phy1>;
	phy-mode = "mii";
	allwinner,leds-active-low;

	phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
		reg = <1>;
	};
};
